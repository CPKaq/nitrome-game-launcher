# Nitrome Game Launcher

The **local version** of Flash Player is still available!

This tool helps you access Flash games on the Nitrome website directly through Flash Player, not browsers. 

The code is badly bad and I will make it better later. 
But maybe not now.

## How to use

Download the zip package and unzip it, then run `nlauncher.exe`.

The package does not contain any game files of Nitrome. Games are obtained online from Nitrome.com.
