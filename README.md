The **local version** of Flash Player is still available!

This tool helps you access Flash games on the Nitrome website directly 
through Flash Player, not browsers. 



## How to use

1. [Download the latest release file](
https://github.com/CPKaq/nitrome-game-launcher/releases) and unzip it

2. run `nlauncher.exe`.


## How does it work

As Adobe Flash Player is no longer supported, Flash Player plugins are 
blocked from browsers after January 12, 2021. However, it is still possible
to run online Flash contents via local versions of Flash Player.

As you select a game in this "launcher", it gets the URL of the `.swf` file 
on `nitrome.com`, and run Flash Player to load the file online. The process 
is similar to loading Flash content via a browser plugin. Your game progress 
will be stored correctly (regardless of whether you have moved or deleted the
launcher), and the URL lock screen will not appear (as you ARE playing the 
game on `nitrome.com` as expected, not some third-party website or local).
